# HopFrog 🐸✨

**HopFrog** is a charming vertical platformer built in **Unity 5**, designed for mobile platforms. You play as a determined little frog leaping from one glowing mushroom to the next — starting from the forest floor and ascending into the starry skies. Each jump is a challenge, each mushroom a milestone. And somewhere up there… perhaps an end awaits?
